# Contributing

I am happy to consider contributions for HarptosJS, but to make the process simple and clear I ask contributors to follow the points below.

## Reporting Bugs
Bugs should be reported in the [Issues](https://github.com/jmosul/harptos-js/issues) tab within the Github repository.  Please provide detailed replication steps to help solve the issue.

## Making Pull Requests
For a contribution to be considered I ask that a [Pull Request](https://github.com/jmosul/harptos-js/pulls) to the master branch is raised.
This will trigger the unit tests and styling linter, these must both be passing before a Pull Request can be merged.

#### Testing
HarptosJS is written in Typescript and its unit tests are run using Jest. HarptosJS has a 95%+ test coverage which should be maintained with each Pull Request.  Coverage reports are automatically posted to the Pull Request on by Github Actions.
