# Contributing

I am happy and grateful to consider contributions for HarptosJS. But to make the process simple and clear I ask contributors to follow the points below.

## Reporting Bugs
Bugs should be reported in the [Issues](https://github.com/jmosul/harptos-js/issues) tab within the Github repository.  Please provide detailed replication steps to help solve the issue.

## Making Pull Requests
For a contribution to be considered I ask that a [Pull Request](https://github.com/jmosul/harptos-js/pulls) to the master branch is raised.

On raising a pull please:
 * Describe the change you have made
 * Link any issues you are resolving (this can be done in commit messages instead if applicable)
 * Ensure Unit Tests are passing and Code Coverage does not decrease (coverage reports are posted to the PR automactically)
 * Ensure styling rules satisfied (a linter runs automatically on pushes to the Pull Request).

#### Semantic Commits
Not essential to making a contribution, but I'd appreciate it if contributors would use [Semantic Commit Messages](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages).

#### Testing
HarptosJS is written in Typescript and its unit tests are run using Jest. HarptosJS has a 95%+ test coverage which should be maintained with each Pull Request.  Coverage reports are automatically posted to the Pull Request on by Github Actions.
